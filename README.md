# Locator Vanish

### Locator vanish adds a new craftable item, the vanish stone! The vanish stone allows the player to hide themselves on the locator bar, or disable it altogether.

Currently only working on the 25w17a snapshot!

# Usage
Right clicking with the vanish stone in hand will hide the player on the locator bar! Right clicking again will make them visible on it. Holding sneak while doing this will instead enable or disable the locator bar, giving the player their experience bar back!
